    <h2>About the Pi</h2>
    <div class="body-text__about">
        <p>
            Welcome to your very own Raspberry pi! I'm a small, and rather simple computer.
            But don't let my size fool you! There's lots i can do.
        </p>
        <p>
            First though, i should probably explain what i am. Ok, so you know i sound a bit like a baked
            dessert. Which is true (no idea why i was called this... Probably some funny reason somewhere).
            But what I am is very small, but fully fledged Linux machine that can do many things. For example,
            someone took one of my brothers into space, while several of my sisters have been turned into
            flying drones! Actually, one of my friends was turned into a secruity system which detected faced!
            Oooo this reminds me of another pi that was turned into a turret and fired at bad guys.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyway, i could go on like this for a while. I won't, mind. I'm here to chat about me.
        </p>
        <p>So, what exsactly is linux? Well, its an Operating System (OS). MUuch like IOS on IPhones, or
            Microsoft Windows is. Little known fact; Linux is the most used OS in the world!
            You know Android phones? Yep, linux. Awesome.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, where do i, a little humble pi (hee hee, pun!), fall into all this? I run a version of Linux built
            especially for devices like me. It's light weight, but easy to change and play with. Which is what I'm
            designed to do!
        </p>
        <p>
            Below is a picture of me:

        <p>
            First thing you should note is my SD card. This is my "Hard drive". For those who aren't technically
            minded, this effectivly my memories. Without it, i wouldn't be able display this page. Or load
            linux. I'd be like a car without an engine. Or a driver. Pretty useless. SO take care in removing this!
        </p>
        <p>
            I also have An HDMI port, as well as an Audio port, an Ethernet port, and two USB ports. HDMI is pretty
            self explanatory. As are the others.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ok, so we are now acquainted. So, what do you do now? Well, if you want my advice, I'd start with creating
            your own website. There's a tutorial on <a href="create-a-website">this page</a>. It'll walk you though how
            to create a basic html page, as well as making it viewable via your home network! Woo!
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you've done that, the world is kinda your oyster. More tutorials will be found
            <a href="http://www.harrywinser.com/projects/pi-tutorials">here</a> eventually.
