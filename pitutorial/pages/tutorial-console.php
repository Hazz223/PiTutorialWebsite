                Ah the command line. Probably the most powerful tool in any developers arsenal. However,
                for the casual user, it's very much over looked. Especially if they're used to Windows or
                OSX.

                So, for those truly drawing a blank on what a Command line (or console, CMD, Command Prompt,
                and the list goes on...) is, in essence its direct access to the computer system. Pretty much everything
                you do on a computer is effectivly bypassing the command line. There isn't anything you can't do with
                the
                command line. It's powerful, but requires some learning to become used to it.

                The above is a screenshot of the commandline from my own computer. You might notice that it looks kinda
                similar to one from a film or t.v. show, especially when it looks like this:
