# PiTutorialWebsite
Simple website for understanding a raspberry pi, as well as a simple tutorial in creating a website.

#Installation
The website is based on PHP, so an Apache installation or someother local server is required to view the pages.
Once you've got that running, download and place this into the WWW folder. Use your browser to navigate to it.
Job done!

# Roadmap
Currently working on getting the pages set up, and some content populated. Spelling is currently an issue, because I've been writing it directly onto the site. NOT GOOD! I'll start switching this to word documents soon. I'll also push these up so people can modify them etc. 

I'll update this section as i continue.
